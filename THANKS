Thanks to Alexander Winston for suggestions on improving configure.ac,
and Makefile.am by using 'autoreconf --warnings=all', and for reminding
me to include src/libgladeTest.gladep in the table of files to include
for re-creating a distribution with 'make distcheck'.

Thanks to Elijah P Newren for recommendation to rename configure.in to
configure.ac and for Web site comments.

Thanks to Ethan Zimmerman for user interface testing and feedback.

Thanks to Keith Sharp for the original public domain code
