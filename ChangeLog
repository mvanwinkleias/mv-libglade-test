  * libgladeTest.glade: Handling prefs-win delete_event (destroy triggered by
  closing a window via window manager) with gtk_widget_hide(). Connected
  show() and hide() methods using libglade.
  * callbacks.c (destroy_event_cb, close_button_cb, cancel_button_cb,
  quit_button_cb, quit_menu_cb, pref_menu_cb): Removed all callbacks that do
  nothing but call stock functions like gtk_widget_show() and
  gtk_widget_hide() in favor of simple libglade connections.
  * callbacks.c (on_main_win_delete_event, on_name_entry_activate): Renamed
  functions from delete_event_cb() and entry_activate_cb() to more descriptive
  on_main_win_delete_event() and on_name_entry_activate().
  * main.c: no need to include "callbacks.h"
