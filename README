libgladeTest -- multi-window libglade example
Copyright (C) 2004 Adam Monsen <adamm@wazamatta.com>

Try the following from the root of the source tarball:
1) ./configure
2) make
3) cd src
4) ./libgladeTest

See INSTALL for boilerplate build/installation instructions.

If you do 'make install', you can only run libgladeTest if you are in
the directory where libgladeTest.glade was installed (probably
/usr/local/share/).

Comments, feedback, suggestions, and constructive criticism are highly
appreciated! Please send any to adamm@wazamatta.com with 'libgladeTest'
somewhere in the subject header.

The latest version of this tarball should always be available here:

A code walkthrough is available here:
